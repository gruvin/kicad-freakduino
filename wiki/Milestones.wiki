==Completed 'Final' (NOT) Tidying Changes r56==

2013-07-21: A bunch of minor issues corrected, including track width increases, silk text-to-component collision fixes, etc. 

*Oops! RF ground plane messed up!* 

Somewhere along the line, I have managed to mess up the RF ground plane and not noticed. There's essentially just one bottom-side ground plane now, so RF and digital on one plane. Oh wow -- and it's obvious even from the 3D rendering below, that the top-side digital ground plane is spilling well into the RF ground plane area, where there is supposed to be a keep-out zone. Grr.

There's also a ground loop being created via two vias, either side of the balun. One of those needs to be removed. Gosh.
 
This will all need fixing, soon as I get the time.

==First completed PCB r42==

First completed PCB, using substituted parts as required by availability. See KiCAD Project file `freakduino-alt.pro`, etc.

Some components and their related layout design work differ from the authentic Freakduino v2.1a. This was driven in the first instance from lack of availability of certain parts, at the time. However, a source was finally found in China or those parts, so I'll _probably_ re-do the PCB design for `freakduino.pro` (no '-alt') KiCAD Project files, using only the original parts and schematic.

Oh and, some minor layout errors were found with regard to positioning of some 0u1 decoupling capacitors (C18, C20, C21 from memory) being not physically near the chips they were intended to be -- from my interpretation of the schematic, anyway. These were "corrected" in this KiCAD rendition.

===Notes for r42 Milestone===

The final routing solution ended up significantly different to Akiba's original design, because it just seemed easier to route using my own brain, than trying to copy. (The different battery holder mounting hole position(s) and the two substituted chips with supporting parts mandated changes, anyway.) However, I was careful to leave the user interaction devices -- antenna and power connectors, dip switches, jumpers and LEDs -- in very similar to original locations, so that the original documentation may better apply to this design.

Looks like the parts in one-off quantities at end-user retail are going to amount to over NZ$130, including PCB fabrication.

The FT232RL is especially high priced, at $11.88. I am considering changing that to the ATmega16U2, with open source USB-to-serial firmware, as used on the more modern Arduinos.

In any case, this exercise has been all about gaining experience, so well worth the cost, for me anyway. I am looking forward to having the test build of the KiCAD Freakduino done and dusted, so I can move on to much smaller boards, for use as discrete sensor network nodes. Should be fun!
