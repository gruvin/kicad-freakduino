==PCBs Ordered for KiCAD-Freakduino v1.0 (r101)==

Enough tinkering already! Time to order the first 10 prototype PCBs and get cracking.

==First Completed PCB r69 ==

First completed PCB, using substituted parts as required by availability. See KiCAD Project file `freakduino-alt.pro`, etc.

(This is at least the sixth time I've thought the design was correctly completed, "for sure". So don't go rushing to build one based on this design, yet! Eventually, I'll have done so and then reported back after testing, whether it actually works or not.)

Some components and their related layout design work differ from the authentic Freakduino v2.1a. This was driven in the first instance from lack of availability of certain parts, at the time. However, a source was finally found in China or those parts, so I'll _probably_ re-do the PCB design for `freakduino.pro` (no '-alt') KiCAD Project files, using only the original parts and schematic.

Oh and, some minor layout errors were found with regard to positioning of some 0u1 decoupling capacitors (C18, C20, C21 from memory) being not physically near the chips they were intended to be -- from my interpretation of the schematic, anyway. These were "corrected" in this KiCAD rendition.

===Notes for r69 Milestone===

The final routing solution ended up significantly different to Akiba's original design, because it just seemed easier to route using my own brain, than trying to copy. (The different battery holder mounting hole position(s) and the two substituted chips with supporting parts mandated changes, anyway.) However, I was careful to leave the user interaction devices -- antenna and power connectors, dip switches, jumpers and LEDs -- in very similar to original locations, so that the original documentation may better apply to this design.

Looks like the parts in one-off quantities at end-user retail are going to amount to over NZ$130, including PCB fabrication. (The genuine Freakduino sells for USD$39.)

The FT232RL is especially high priced, at $11.88. I am considering changing that to the ATmega16U2, with open source USB-to-serial firmware, as used on the more modern Arduinos.

In any case, this exercise has been all about gaining experience, so well worth the cost, for me anyway. I am looking forward to having the test build of the KiCAD Freakduino done and dusted, so I can move on to much smaller boards, for use as discrete sensor network nodes. Should be fun!
