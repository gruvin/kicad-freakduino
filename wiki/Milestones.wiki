==PCBs Ordered for KiCAD-Freakduino v1.0 (r116)==

Enough tinkering already! Time to order the first 10 prototype PCBs and get cracking.

I've ordered 10x PCBs (minimum quantity) and all the parts to build two boards, with the usual bulk left-over resistors, capacitors purchased for reasons of economy and use in later projects.

 NOTE:  Enough parts to build just two (2) of these boards has cost more than USD$200, including the PCBs. So don't bother building, unless you really want the educational experience, as I did. Instead, just buy genuine, completed units from the [http://freaklabsstore.com/ freaklabsstore.com] at just USD$36 ea. (2013-07-23) fully built and tested.

My goal ultimately is not to build Arduino compatible boards, but small, bare bones boards based on what I've learned here, for use in sensor networks and for wireless remote control. I'd also like to play about with low power Bluetoothâ„¢ and Wi-Fi, as experience and understanding increases. But who knows.

===Notes for r116 Milestone===

Some components and their related layout design work differ from the authentic Freakduino v2.1a. This was driven in the first instance from lack of availability of certain parts, at the time. A source was finally located in China and parts ordered. But I decided to stick with the more readily available versions anyway.

So, the final routing solution ended up significantly different to Akiba's original design, because it just seemed easier to route using my own brain, than trying to copy. (The different battery holder mounting hole position(s) and the two substituted chips with supporting parts mandated changes, anyway.) However, I was careful to leave the user interaction devices -- antenna and power connectors, dip switches, jumpers and LEDs -- in very similar to original locations, so that the original documentation may better apply to this design.

Some minor layout errors were found with regard to positioning of some 0u1 decoupling capacitors (C18, C20, C21 from memory) in the authentic Freakduino. Nothing serious, just some swapped positions, basically. In any case, these were "corrected" in this KiCAD rendition.
